# Allstate Claims Severity Project


This project is a submission to Kaggle's Allstate Severity Claims competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity) on Kaggle. This was made as motivation for a Capstone Project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

The project consists of two main parts:
<ol>
    <li> 
        <b> 
        EDA: 
        </b>
        The given dataset is thoroughly analyzed and visualized through various means.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> 
        <b>
        XGBoost Training, Testing, and Tuning: 
        </b>
        The powerful and classic XGBoost model is used in tandem with a series of hyper-parameter optimization
        techniques, including the reliable GridSearchCV, to produce an optimal model with which to predict the 
        target variable, loss.
    </li>
        
</ol>
