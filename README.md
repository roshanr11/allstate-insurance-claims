# Allstate Claims Severity Project


This project is a crack at Kaggle's Allstate Severity Claims competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity) on Kaggle. This was made as motivation for a Capstone Project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

The project consists of two main parts:
    1) EDA:
        The given dataset is thoroughly analyzed and visualized through various means.
    2) XGBoost Training, Testing, and Tuning:
        The powerful and classic XGBoost model is used in tandem with a series of hyper-parameter optimization
        techniques, including the reliable GridSearchCV, to produce an optimal model with which to predict the 
        target variable, loss.
